The development of the aforementioned project involved writing JS, CSS, and HTML code in a single file.
This approach was undertaken as a challenging exercise, starting with the use of basic notepad tools and then transitioning to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), with the goal of enhancing the learning process and elevating the overall complexity of the project.
It is highly recommended to follow the same methodology, as opposed to relying on the IDE to complete code. Moreover, conventional practices of separating JS and CSS code into separate folders were not employed, opting instead to maintain all code within one file for optimal system readability, thereby avoiding any potential errors that may arise from copying files.

Given the unpredictable nature of linear regression in machine learning for AI, I have opted to employ conventional programming techniques to enhance accuracy.
To achieve this, logical operators have been heavily utilized for branching, allowing for the omission of training/test sets and input/output sets.
This approach aims to streamline the system, focusing exclusively on its intended purpose, without the need for extensive training on data patterns.
Similarly, the use of GPT-3 remains a subject of debate, as it is uncertain whether it is suitable for integration with AMS.
The primary focus of employee interactions should remain within the bounds of the company's procedures, rather than venturing beyond these boundaries.
AMS serves as a fail-safe in the event of an unexpected reduction in the number of trained personnel.

AMS leverages a combination of modals and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to elevate the experience of internal customers. 
These advanced capabilities serve to optimize interaction, facilitating seamless communication, and promoting efficiency in operations.
To gain access to the modals: type "outlook" in the Chatbot
                              another example: type "to do" in the Chatbot 
To utilize the NLP features: Press on the mic at the Chatbot and ask verbally: David Please 
                             ASK David verbally: All OK David?
                                                 What is amnesty?
