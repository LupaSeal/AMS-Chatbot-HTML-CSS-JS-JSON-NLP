The development of the aforementioned project involved writing JS, CSS, and HTML code in a single file.
This approach was undertaken as a challenging exercise, starting with the use of basic notepad tools and then transitioning to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), with the goal of enhancing the learning process and elevating the overall complexity of the project.
It is highly recommended to follow the same methodology, as opposed to relying on the IDE to complete code. Moreover, conventional practices of separating JS and CSS code into separate folders were not employed, opting instead to maintain all code within one file for optimal system readability, thereby avoiding any potential errors that may arise from copying files.
